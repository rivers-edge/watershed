            I have a complex dissociative disorder (CDD) which affects my functional memory. I work with a specialist in the topic and I'm open to discussions about it. 
            I am disabled on multiple axes as I also have a chronic illness.

        <p>I don't like itemizing myself like this, but it can be helpful to present a list of shared experiences rather than to write a bibliography;</p>

            My given name is not River. 
            I chose the name River for myself not only for the obvious geoscience connection, 
            but because I am extremely passionate about the interconnectedness of our Earth systems. 
            A river is a flux point between systems, but it is also a system itself. 
            We are a system of our thoughts and desires, and we are also a part of a larger system of thoughts and desires â€” those from our fields, family, peers, enemies, masters, servants, etc.

    <p>I keep extensive lists of resources and research documents on several of these topics. If you would like to discuss my library, reach out to me on Discord. I'm not currently checking emails. </p>
    <p>Keep in mind I keep this list dynamic. My content is current, albeit a work in progress.</p>
    <p>All of the content on my pages was created by myself. Please respectfully admire my artwork from a distance, and do not save copies of my pieces locally to your personal folder unless we've already explicitly spoken beforehand.</p>
