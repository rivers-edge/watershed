    <p>
        I have a complex dissociative disorder (CDD) which affects my functional memory.
        I am disabled on multiple axes as I also have a chronic illness.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't like itemizing myself like this, but it can be helpful to present a list of shared experiences rather than to write a bibliography;
        Additionally, please do not consider this a list of my <em>diagnoses</em>. 
        I will always validate educated self-diagnosis. 
        And finally, I only share to advertise the sorts of experiences I can relate to. 
        Your diagnostic status does not matter to me, but your experiences will always be heard.

            I'm trying to be a better person but I can't do that if I have no idea there is an issue.

            My given name is not River.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose the name River for myself not only for the obvious geoscience connection, but because I am extremely passionate about the interconnectedness of our Earth systems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A river is a flux point between systems, but it is also a system itself. We are a system of our thoughts and desires, and we are also a part of a larger system of thoughts and desires â€” those from our fields, family, peers, enemies, masters, servants, etc.

            If you saw "radfemme" in relation to me, I'd like to clarify on what that means. 
            I am transgender and I transitioned from female to male starting in 2014. I no longer identify with the "male" label and have been on some form of detransitioning journey for the past three years-ish. I was on testosterone for seven years before that, and I got top surgery about a year after coming out to my parents. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I no longer identify with that label, I can't confirm what label I identify with. 
            I no longer feel as though the "male" label serves me since my rejection of my female identity was in response to a trauma I had experienced.
            Whereas trauma is a major part of my identity, I don't want it to be the way that I am percieved, down to my gender.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am non-binary and radical acceptance has been my bedrock, the new way that I see myself beyond hitting <em>"rock bottom"</em>.

        I keep extensive lists of resources and research documents on several of these topics.

        Keep in mind I keep this list dynamic. My content is current, albeit a work in progress.</p>
