        I have a complex dissociative disorder (CDD) which affects my functional memory.
        I am disabled on multiple axes as I also have a chronic illness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Diagnosis is privilege; it's intended for billing purposes. 
        Your diagnostic status does not matter to me & your experiences will always be heard.
        If you are against self diagnosis, you are supporting the insurance industry.

            A river is a flux point between systems, but it is also a system itself. We are a system of our thoughts and desires, and we are also a part of a larger system of thoughts and desires â€” those from our fields, family, peers, enemies, masters, servants, etc. 
            Earth is finite/infinite, as are we & all the creatures that live here.

            I am transgender and I transitioned from female to male starting in 2014. I no longer identify with the "male" label and have been on some form of detransitioning journey for the past three years-ish. I was on testosterone for seven years before that, and I got top surgery about a year after coming out to my parents. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I no longer identify with the male label, I can't confirm what label I identify with. 
            I no longer feel as though the "male" label serves me since my rejection of my female identity was in response to a trauma I had experienced.
            Whereas trauma is a major part of my identity, I don't want it to be the way that I am percieved, down to my gender.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am non-binary and radical acceptance has been my bedrock, the new way that I see myself beyond hitting <em>"rock bottom"</em>.

        I have a bachelors of science in Geology, with a minor in Environmental Science. I graduated from Rutgers-Newark with honors in 2021.
        Prior to that I graduated from Essex County College, right across the street.
